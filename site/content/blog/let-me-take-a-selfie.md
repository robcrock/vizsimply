One of my data viz friends, who arguably has THE most enviable domain name, [dataviz.love](http://dataviz.love/), recently introduced me to a fun sketching project. In the project [Giorgia Lupi](http://giorgialupi.com/), master of pretty, personalized data visualizations and more,¬†shares a step-by-step approach we can follow to draw selfies.

Now, don't let the lightheartedness of sketching, obscure the deeper point.¬†Giorgia has far more meaningful motives than helping you attract more Insta followers ‚ù§Ô∏è

## How do I know?

I know, because Giorgia shares her views in this [post](https://medium.com/@giorgialupi/data-humanism-the-revolution-will-be-visualized-31486a30dbfb) and this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr_P1rdj_Zk). There she elaborates on how data visualization and design have the potential to make us more human .

In the post, we are reminded that "data is primarily human-made. ‚ÄúData-driven‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean ‚Äúunmistakably true,‚Äù and it never did."

She goes on to encourage us, by saying "we should keep in mind how data can be a powerful tool for all‚Ä¶, bringing stories to life in a visual way and adding structural meaning to our projects."

## What better story to bring to life than our lives?

For attendees of TED 2017 in Toronto, Giorgia‚Äôs design agency [Accurat](https://www.accurat.it/), along with [David Stark Design](http://davidstarkdesign.com/mobile/), created a personalized button making framework for attendees.

Don‚Äôt worry; I am feeling the FOMO too. I can only imagine how many people connected on a personal level thanks to these cute, catalysts for conversation.

The [D3 Unconf](http://visfest.com/) shares similar shenanigans with their attendees.

During registration, you're asked to create a GIF of any chart you have made with D3. This exercise serves as both a filter to ensure all attendees have used D3, while also providing organizers with something GIFable (is that a real word).

Here‚Äôs [Nadieh Bremer](https://www.visualcinnamon.com/), playing with a badge the Unconf Organizers made from of her [Data Sketches visualization for July](http://www.datasketch.es/july/code/nadieh/).

Thankfully you don‚Äôt need a conference or experience with D3 to sketch your selfie. Giorgia Lupi has created a step-by-step, so anyone can make a personalized self-portrait.

Here‚Äôs what I look like on paper.

Thankfully, this isn‚Äôt a beauty contest.

Anyone can play this game. It‚Äôs fun for kids, colleagues, classmates, literally anyone with a few colored pencils (or pens) and a piece of paper.

To get started grab a handful of your preferred drawing utensils. To follow Giorgia's framework you are going to need a few colors. Of course you can go bare bones with shades of grey, but color's more fun. At the very least, grab a pack of Crayola off the shelf of the nearest convenient store.

Here's step one of Lupi's [guide](https://ideas.ted.com/how-to-draw-your-own-selfie-using-your-personal-data/) to get you going

In an upcoming post, I‚Äôll share a framework I made up to see myself from another angle.
