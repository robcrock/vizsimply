Cole, of storytelling with data, doesn’t host public redesigns often. This is a rare opportunity to practice with a master.

Cole has been busily globetrotting for years teaching people at almost any company you can think of how to better tell stories with their data. She finds particular value in the power of storytelling, which you can learn more about by reading her [book](http://www.storytellingwithdata.com/book/) or attending her [public workshops](http://www.storytellingwithdata.com/public-workshops/).

Earlier this year I had the privilege of attending one of her public workshops. I had few expectations coming into the workshop, having attended several others in the past. As soon as I entered the classroom, I knew this was going to be different.

Cole goes to great lengths, in her workshops, to ensure attendees walk away with new found knowledge they can directly apply to their work. This workshop pushed me to not only leverage methods used by Disney to craft cohesive stories, but also detangle contorted visualizations through best practices taught throughout the day-long training.

During this public redesign, you’ll have a chance to think critically about a visualization, clean it and add your own flare much like you would during these workshops. If you would like a better idea of what the end result might look like, you can see a past redesign [here](http://www.storytellingwithdata.com/blog/2011/11/visual-makeover-income-and-expenses).

## So, how do we participate?

Cole’s ask is simple. She wants you to show the data as you would if it was your own data to report. She also asks that you provide a new headline. You can read her original post [here](http://www.storytellingwithdata.com/).

Be sure to email your redesign to Cole at [makeover@storytellingwithdata.com](mailto:makeover@storytellingwithdata.com) before Friday September, 22nd.

## Part 2 coming soon

In the next [part](https://vizsimply.com/blog/2017/9/19/rare-redesign-for-storytelling-with-data-p2) of this series, I’ll share the steps I took to clean up this visualization.
