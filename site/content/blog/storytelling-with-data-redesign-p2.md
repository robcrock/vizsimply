In [part 1](https://vizsimply.com/blog/2017/9/17/rare-redesign-for-storytelling-with-data-p1) of this storytelling with data redesign series, we simply set the stage. In this post, we walk through the cleanup process.

## WHAT'S OUR OBJECTIVE?

Most people are going to jump straight into the cleanup process as you might with a messy room. What’s out of place and where can I put it, so the room looks tidy again?

No surprises here. I am going to approach the visual clean up the same way. In part 3 of this series, I’ll share a full redesign. You can think of a redesign as the process of reorienting the furniture to better meet our needs instead of simply tidying up, which is what you get from a quick clean-up exercise.

In Cole’s [workshops](http://www.storytellingwithdata.com/public-workshops/), you’ll learn how to declutter a piece. The process of decluttering strip away distractions, while emphasizing the most important elements of your visual narrative.

At this point, I’m going to assume everyone has been startled by a viz once or twice. It’s hard not to with a visual system like ours. All that information is streamed straight to our visual context at once and it’s rarely constructed with much thought given to how well the users will interpret what was made. Remember, it’s your job, as the data viz pro, to clean the scene so insights are gleaned as accurately and efficiently as possible.

## WHERE DO WE BEGIN?

The steps taken to clean up a visualization aren’t nearly as deep as those of a full redesign, but we will cover that process in the next part of this series. For now, let’s focus on cleaning up what we have been given.

With all the mess put away, we can start the redesign. A full remodel mean we get to construct a completely new chart or collection of charts to more powerfully communicate our message.

In [part 3](https://vizsimply.com/blog/2017/9/21/rare-redesign-for-storytelling-with-data-part-3) of this series, I will introduce you to a fellow data viz friend of mine, [Craig Dewar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/craig-dewar/), from Sydney and walk you through our redesigns.
