Short of popping a chip into your brain Matrix style or taking the blue pill, there is no better way of gathering insights from your data than data visualization. Simple shapes do a great job communicating the information hidden in your data.

You have heard the phrase "a picture is worth a thousand words" many times before. Data visualization is just that for our data. Instead of reading each row visuals roll the details up into forms we can draw patterns from immediately.

If you want to think strategically about your business you need to visualize your data.

### How Data Visualization Help?

When forced to read through a table of numbers you scan the rows, make mental calculations all while working to keep the high-level problems top of minds. Regardless of how experienced you are carrying out this task it is a serious cognative load!

Data visualization offloads most of the mental work to the large part of your brain responsible for visual process, leaving room for the rest of your brain to more strategically about the answers you are after.

> By leveraging data visualization you are able to make faster decisions more accurately.

Examples of data visualization in your work could be sales dashboards letting the team know whether they should be pushing for more sales or focusing on other areas of their funnel. You may favor a dashboard displaying the saw tooth nature of inventory cycles, rather rushing out shipments on the last minute.

You could even create a story for stakeholders walking them through all you have accomplished this past quarterly or leverage data visualization to enhance a pitch to prospective backers. Research shows that charts increase the credability of your story by 70%.

### How did I get into this field?

I couldn't unsee the impact data visualization made for my clients.

Data visualization has turn lightbulbson on for executives in my work with supply chains, utilities, banks, startups, nonprofits and more. Data visualization, when done well, resonates with audiences like few other forms of communication.

My first Aha! moment happened while provide data for the strategy and business development team of a major Fortune 500 comapny. The final output I sent off to this team was a summary of  optimization models I ran for a 5 year manufacturing and distribution strategy.

Traditionally the results of these models were summarized in Excel so these Harvard, MIT and name your Ivy MBA grads could discuss strategy. The teams was brilliant, but we weren't giving them the full picture of how out models came to the conclusions they did with tables in Excel.

Thankfully, Tableau was coming into its own at the time and I was able to take the results of these models and display them as a distribution network across our business that came **much** closer to telling this story.

The results, as you can imagine, were astonishing. The difference was so stark that I remember feeling remorse for having made decisions any other way. Our visuals allowed this team to ask questions of the data and gain much more insights.

From that role I went on to develop and design dashboard for sales organizations. I also consulted throughout the Bay Area with notable companies such Pinterest and Charles Schwab.

Regardless of who I served the results were similar.

Data visualization enables teams to ask the important questions that make a difference for their business, rather than being bogged down by the details.
