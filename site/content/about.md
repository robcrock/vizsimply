## WHO IS ROB?

![](/img/about/head-shot.png)

I am a freelance data visualization professional traveling the world to help clients looking to leverage data with visualization.

My journey began in 2011 when I used Tableau to plot supply chain distributions networks across a map of the US. It was then that I realized how powerful data visualization is when making important decision. Before developing those maps, our strategy and business development teams were basing their decisions off of rudimentary Excel tables.

After caping out what the business side of the house was comfortable with me doing technically, so I moved to into a role in the Information Technology department. The gave me the opportunity to craft the entire data visualization pipeline, from SQL stored procedures to dashboards, for the units I was helping to support.

After spending years understanding how to optimize SQL queries, I found my self gravitating back into visuals designs. So, I uprooted from Atlanta, Georgia to San Francisco, California in hopes of deepening my technical skills and design sense.

In San Francisco, I not only helped clients like First Republic Bank roll out Tableau Server to their organization but also delivered custom Tableau dashboards to the likes of Charles Schwab, Pinterest and others. During my time at Slalom, we incorporated much more than Tableau to design our dashboards. Thinking outside the scope of a single application stepped up my skills tremendously, and I thoroughly enjoyed my time there.

I now travel to clients all over the world to train data visualization professionals, execute projects for clients and inspire as many people as I can who are interested in joining the flourishing community of data visualization professionals around the world.
